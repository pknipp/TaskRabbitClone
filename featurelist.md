                      TaskRabbit Feature List

## MVP:

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to select a task **so that** I can be provided with an appropriate list of possible taskers, including price and skill level.
* Estimated Time: 2 days
* Dates: Aug 10-11

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to filter/sort further the tasker list **so that** I can view a list ordered by my preferences.
* Estimated Time: 0.5 days
* Dates: Aug 12

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to select a tasker, (at which time Iâ€™ll be prompted to create a user account, if not done already) **so that** I can plan on having the task done on a particular date for a particular price and specify details about the job.
* Estimated Time: 1 days
* Dates: Aug 12-13

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to access my account **so that** I can view, manage, and cancel jobs and view/edit my account details (e.g., name, password, email, address, phone number, etc).
* Estimated Time: 1.5 days
* Dates: Aug 13-14

## Stretch:

**As a** tasker, **I want** to be able to create a profile (inputting my skills and hourly rate) **so that** I can get matched with potential customers and accept/reject the job.

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to specify a day/time for the task, **so that** it happens according to my desired schedule.
