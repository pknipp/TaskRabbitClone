                      TaskRabbit Feature List

## MVP:

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to select a task (and - if appropriate - to select a sub-task) and specify details **so that** I can be provided with an appropriate list of possible taskers, including price and skill level.
* Estimated Time: 2 days

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to filter/sort further the tasker list **so that** I can view a list ordered by my preferences.
* Estimated Time: 0.5 days

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to select a tasker, **so that** I can plan on having the task done on a particular date for a particular price.
* Estimated Time: 1 days

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to create an account **so that** I can view, manage, and cancel jobs.
* Estimated Time: 1.5 days

## Stretch:

**As a** tasker, **I want** to be able to create a profile (inputting my skills and hourly rate) **so that** I can get matched with potential customers and accept/reject the job.

**As a** user, **I want** to be able to specify a day/time for the task, **so that** it happens according to my desired schedule.
